This is a resubmission.

* I added a `value` section to `pkrt_set()`.
* I specified the class of the output in `pkrt_list()`.
* I removed `utils::installed.packages()` usage and replaced it with a more effecient alternative.
* There's no particular references for the methods used in my package to add to the package description.

## R CMD check results
