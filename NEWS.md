# pakret 0.2.0

* Added `book` as a second BibTeX type that should be used in priority when getting the reference of a package (previously, the priority was given to `manual` entries only). This allows for a slightly better handling of multi-reference packages by using a more general reference when there's a `book` but no `manual` BibTeX entry available (#15).

* `as.data.frame.pkrt_list()` now arranges packages in alphabetical order (#13).

# pakret 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
