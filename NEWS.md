# pakret (development version)

# pakret 0.2.2

* pakret can now write references in multiple `.bib` files within the same document (#26).

* Fixed an issue with `pkrt_set(bib =)` that may lead to the replication or deletion of some bib entries in the newly defined `.bib` file in some edge cases (#22).

# pakret 0.2.1

* pakret now can cite references that have a pre-written key (#18).

* Fixed alphabetical ordering of package names in `as.data.frame.pkrt_list()` (#19).

# pakret 0.2.0

* Added `book` as a second BibTeX type that should be used in priority when getting the reference of a package (previously, the priority was given to `manual` entries only). This allows for a slightly better handling of multi-reference packages by using a more general reference when there's a `book` but no `manual` BibTeX entry available (#15).

* `as.data.frame.pkrt_list()` now arranges packages in alphabetical order (#13).

# pakret 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
